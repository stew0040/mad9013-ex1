        <h1>The Moon</h1>
        <h2>A Natural Satellite</h2>
          <p>The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth, and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar                          System. It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its                    primary, having a quarter the diameter of Earth but only 1⁄81 its' mass.</p>
